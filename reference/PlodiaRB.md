# Resistance (as a binary trait) of Indian meal moth caterpillars to the granulosis virus PiGV.

Resistance (as a binary trait) of Indian meal moth (*Plodia
interpunctella*) caterpillars to the granulosis virus PiGV.

## Usage

``` r
data(PlodiaRB)
```

## Format

a data frame with 784 rows and 4 columns, with variables indicating
full- sib family (`FSfamly`), date of egg laying (`date_laid`) and
assaying (`date_Ass`), and a binary variable indicating whether an
individual was resistant (`Pupated`) to an experimental infection of the
virus. These data are identical to those in the data.frame `PlodiaR`
except each family-level binomial variable has been expanded into a
binary variable for each individual.
