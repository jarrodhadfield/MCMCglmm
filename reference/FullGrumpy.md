# Full Grumpy Scores of Academics

Ordinal ratings of grumpiness as assessed from photos of academics.

## Usage

``` r
data(FullGrumpy)
```

## Format

A data frame with 5,368 rows and 8 columns. Two photos (`photo`) of 22
people (`person`) working in the Institute of Evolution and Ecology,
Edinburgh, were taken. In one photo the person was happy and in the
other they were grumpy (`type`). 122 `respondents` gave a score between
1 and 10 (`y`) indicating how grumpy they thought each person looked in
each photo (with 10 being the most grumpy). The `age` of the person
photographed and the number of years between when they published their
first academic paper and the photo was taken (`ypub`) were recorded.
Whether the `respondent` was a `student` in the institute was also
recorded.
