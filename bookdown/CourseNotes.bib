  abstract	= {Random utility models often involve terms which represent

		  feature of the multinomial probit (MNP) model is that it
		  allows a rather general covariance structure for these
		  errors. However, since observed choices only reveal
		  information regarding utility differences, and since scale
		  cannot be determined, not all parameters in an arbitrary
		  MNP specification may be identified. This paper examines
		  identification restrictions that arise in the
		  linear-in-parameters multinomial probit framework, and
		  provides discussion and recommendations for estimation and
		  analysis of probit normalizations.},

		  strategic use can result in a Gibbs sampler having easily

		  paper, therefore, is to provide an alternative sampling
		  algorithm to rejection-based methods and other sampling
		  approaches such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.},
